            <span class="larger">San Francisco's</span> housing crisis is a topic often spoken about with 
            the level of caution used to prevent an egg from cracking. While it's
            good people recognize the precarious nature of homelessness, that same 
            sensitivity frequently prevents the conversation from advancing beyond 
            agreeing there's a problem and a fix is necessary.

            Following the dotcom bust and financial crisis, evictions fell, 
            which at first seems countercyclical. The number of evictions for
            2017, the last recorded full year, is down 27% from the previous
            year and 55% compared to peak evictions in 1998. However, 2017 is
            up 22% from 2009's record low. At the time of publication, 2018 is on
            track to have the fewest evictions recorded.
